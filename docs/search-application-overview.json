Go to *Search > Search Applications*.\n. Select *Create*.\n. Select the {es} indices you want to use for your search application.\n. Name your search application.\n. Select *Create*.\n\nYour search application should now be available in the list.\n\n//[.screenshot]\n// image::../../images/search-applications/search-applications-create.png[Create search application screen]\n\nOnce created, you can explore the documents in your search application under *Search > Search Applications >* _your-search-application_ > *Docs Explorer*.\nFrom there, you can expand a matching {es} document to see its full contents.\n\n//[.screenshot]\n// image::../../images/search-applications/search-applications-docs-explorer.png[Docs explorer screen with search results]\n\n[discrete]\n[[search-application-overview-get-started-api]]\n==== Option 2: Get started with the API\n\nUse the {es} <<put-search-application,Put Search Application API>> to create a search application.\n\n\nThe following example creates a search application named `my_search_application` that searches over the `my_search_index1` and `my_search_index2` indices, along with defining a simple search template (Refer to <<search-application-api-default-template>>).\n\n[source,console]\n----\nPUT /_application/search_application/my_search_application\n{\n  \"indices\": [ \"my_search_index1\", \"my_search_index2\" ],\n  \"template\": {\n    \"script\": {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"query\": {\n          \"query_string\": {\n            \"query\": \"{{query_string}}\",\n            \"default_field\": \"{{default_field}}\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"params\": {\n        \"query_string\": \"*\",\n        \"default_field\": \"*\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n----\n// TEST[skip:TODO]\n\n[discrete]\n[[search-application-overview-get-started-templates]]\n==== Search templates\n\nSearch templates are the heart of your search applications.\nThe <<search-application-api-default-template,default template>> created for a search application is very minimal, and you'll want to customize it to suit your needs.\n<<search-application-api>> contains a number of examples to get you started, including the default template, as well as templates for text search, semantic search and hybrid search.\n\ninclude::search-application-api.asciidoc[]\ninclude::search-application-security.asciidoc[]\ninclude::search-application-client.asciidoc[]\n"
