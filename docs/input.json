This payload is accessible during the subsequent watch execution \nphases. For example, you can base a watch's condition on the data loaded by its\ninput.\n\n{watcher} supports four input types: \n\n* <<input-simple,`simple`>>: load static data into the execution context.\n* <<input-search,`search`>>: load the results of a search into the execution \ncontext.\n* <<input-http,`http`>>: load the results of an HTTP request into the execution\ncontext.\n* <<input-chain,`chain`>>: use a series of inputs to load data into the \nexecution context.\n\nNOTE: If you don't define an input for a watch, an empty payload is loaded\n      into the execution context.\n\ninclude::input/simple.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::input/search.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::input/http.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::input/chain.asciidoc[]\n"
