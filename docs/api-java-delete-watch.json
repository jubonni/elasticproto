Do not delete the\n            watch directly from the `.watches` index using Elasticsearch's DELETE\n            Document API. If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, make sure\n            no `write` privileges are granted to anyone over the `.watches` index.\n\nThe following example deletes a watch with the `my-watch` id:\n\n[source,java]\n--------------------------------------------------\nDeleteWatchResponse deleteWatchResponse = watcherClient.prepareDeleteWatch(\"my-watch\").get();\n--------------------------------------------------\n"
