You may want to increase the strength of\nencryption used when using a Oracle JVM; the IcedTea OpenJDK ships without these\nrestrictions in place. This step is not required to successfully use encrypted\ncommunication.\n\nThe _Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy\nFiles_ enable the use of additional cipher suites for Java in a separate JAR file\nthat you need to add to your Java installation. You can download this JAR file\nfrom Oracle's http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[download page].\nThe _JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files`_ are required for\nencryption with key lengths greater than 128 bits, such as 256-bit AES encryption.\n\nAfter installation, all cipher suites in the JCE are available for use but requires\nconfiguration in order to use them. To enable the use of stronger cipher suites\nwith {es} {security-features}, configure the\n<<ssl-tls-settings,`cipher_suites` parameter>>.\n\nNOTE: The _JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files_ must be installed\n      on all nodes in the cluster to establish an improved level of encryption\n      strength.\n"
