On <<rpm,RPM>> and <<deb,Debian>> packages,\nthis directory is `/var/log/elasticsearch`. On <<targz,Linux and MacOS>> and <<zip-windows,Windows>> distributions, the `logs`\ndirectory is located under the root of the {es} installation.\n\nThese are logs produced by the JVM when it encounters a fatal error, such as a\nsegmentation fault. If this path is not suitable for receiving logs,\nmodify the `-XX:ErrorFile=...` entry in <<set-jvm-options,`jvm.options`>>.\n"
