This field effectively stores data the\nsame way as a `text` field that only indexes documents (`index_options: docs`)\nand disables norms (`norms: false`). Term queries perform as fast if not faster\nas on `text` fields, however queries that need positions such as the\n<<query-dsl-match-query-phrase,`match_phrase` query>> perform slower as they\nneed to look at the `_source` document to verify whether a phrase matches. All\nqueries return constant scores that are equal to 1.0.\n\nAnalysis is not configurable: text is always analyzed with the\n<<specify-index-time-default-analyzer,default analyzer>>\n(<<analysis-standard-analyzer,`standard`>> by default).\n\n<<span-queries,span queries>> are not supported with this field, use\n<<query-dsl-intervals-query,interval queries>> instead, or the\n<<text-field-type,`text`>> field type if you absolutely need span queries.\n\nOther than that, `match_only_text` supports the same queries as `text`. And\nlike `text`, it does not support sorting and has only limited support for aggregations.\n\n[source,console]\n----\nPUT logs\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"@timestamp\": {\n        \"type\": \"date\"\n      },\n      \"message\": {\n        \"type\": \"match_only_text\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n----\n\n[discrete]\n[[match-only-text-params]]\n==== Parameters for match-only text fields\n\nThe following mapping parameters are accepted:\n\n[horizontal]\n\n<<multi-fields,`fields`>>::\n\n    Multi-fields allow the same string value to be indexed in multiple ways for\n    different purposes, such as one field for search and a multi-field for\n    sorting and aggregations, or the same string value analyzed by different\n    analyzers.\n\n<<mapping-field-meta,`meta`>>::\n\n    Metadata about the field.\n"
