It signals that additional storage capacity is necessary\nwhen existing capacity has been exceeded (reactively).\n\nThe reactive storage decider is enabled for all policies governing data nodes and has no configuration options.\n\nThe decider relies partially on using <<data-tier-allocation,data tier preference>>\nallocation rather than node attributes. In particular, scaling a data tier into\nexistence (starting the first node in a tier) will result in starting a node in\nany data tier that is empty if not using allocation based on data tier preference.\nUsing the <<ilm-migrate,ILM migrate>> action to migrate between tiers is the\npreferred way of allocating to tiers and fully supports scaling a tier into\nexistence.\n"
