This service runs automatically on Elastic Cloud for Elastic managed connectors.\n* The `service_type` parameter should reference a supported third-party service. See the available service types for <<es-native-connectors,Elastic managed>> and <<es-build-connector,self-managed>> connectors. This can also reference the service type of your custom connector.\n\n\n[[create-connector-api-desc]]\n==== {api-description-title}\n\nCreates a connector document in the internal index and initializes its configuration, filtering, and scheduling with default values.
