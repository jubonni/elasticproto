This privilege is included in the \n`machine_learning_admin` built-in role.\n\n[[ml-close-job-desc]]\n== {api-description-title}\n\nA job can be opened and closed multiple times throughout its lifecycle.\n\nA closed job cannot receive data or perform analysis operations, but you can\nstill explore and navigate results.\n\nIf you close an {anomaly-job} whose {dfeed} is running, the request first tries\nto stop the {dfeed}. This behavior is equivalent to calling\n<<ml-stop-datafeed,stop {dfeed}>> with the same `timeout` and `force` parameters\nas the close job request.\n\nWhen you close a job, it runs housekeeping tasks such as pruning the model history,\nflushing buffers, calculating final results and persisting the model snapshots.\nDepending upon the size of the job, it could take several minutes to close and\nthe equivalent time to re-open.\n\nAfter it is closed, the job has a minimal overhead on the cluster except for\nmaintaining its metadata. Therefore it is a best practice to close jobs that\nare no longer required to process data.\n\nWhen a {dfeed} that has a specified end date stops, it automatically closes\nits associated job.\n\nNOTE: If you use the `force` query parameter, the request returns without performing\nthe associated actions such as flushing buffers and persisting the model snapshots.\nTherefore, do not use this parameter if you want the job to be in a consistent state\nafter the close job API returns. The `force` query parameter should only be used in\nsituations where the job has already failed, or where you are not interested in\nresults the job might have recently produced or might produce in the future.\n\n[[ml-close-job-path-parms]]\n== {api-path-parms-title}\n\n`<job_id>`::\n(Required, string)\ninclude::{es-ref-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=job-id-anomaly-detection-wildcard]\n+\nYou can close all jobs by using `_all` or by specifying `*` as the job\nidentifier.\n\n[[ml-close-job-query-parms]]\n== {api-query-parms-title}\n\n`allow_no_match`::\n(Optional, Boolean)\ninclude::{es-ref-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=allow-no-match-jobs]\n\n`force`::\n  (Optional, Boolean) Use to close a failed job, or to forcefully close a job\n  which has not responded to its initial close request.\n\n`timeout`::\n  (Optional, <<time-units, time units>>) Controls the time to wait until a job \n  has closed. The default value is 30 minutes.\n\n[[ml-close-job-request-body]]\n== {api-request-body-title}\n\nYou can also specify the query parameters (such as `allow_no_match` and `force`)\nin the request body.\n\n[[ml-close-job-response-codes]]\n== {api-response-codes-title}\n\n`404` (Missing resources)::\n  If `allow_no_match` is `false`, this code indicates that there are no \n  resources that match the request or only partial matches for the request.\n\n[[ml-close-job-example]]\n== {api-examples-title}\n\n[source,console]\n--------------------------------------------------\nPOST _ml/anomaly_detectors/low_request_rate/_close\n--------------------------------------------------\n// TEST[skip:Kibana sample data]\n\nWhen the job is closed, you receive the following results:\n\n[source,console-result]\n----\n{\n  \"closed\": true\n}\n----\n"
