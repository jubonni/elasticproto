No supported operating systems use\nthe `SysV init` process.\n\n*Details* +\nEnsure your nodes use a\nhttps://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_os[supported operating system].\nRunning {es} on an unsupported operating system can result in unexpected errors\nor failures.\n====\n\n.Java 17 is required.\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\nJava 17 or higher is now required to run {es} and any of its command\nline tools.\n\n*Impact* +\nUse Java 17 or higher. Attempts to run {es} 8.0 using earlier Java versions will\nfail.\n\nThere is not yet a FIPS-certified security module for Java 17 \nthat you can use when running {es} 8.0 in FIPS 140-2 mode. \nIf you run in FIPS 140-2 mode, you will either need to request an exception \nfrom your security organization to upgrade to {es} 8.0, \nor remain on {es} 7.x until Java 17 is certified.\n====\n\n.`JAVA_HOME` is no longer supported.\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\n`JAVA_HOME` is no longer supported to set the path for the JDK. Instead, use\nthe bundled JDK (preferable), or set `ES_JAVA_HOME`.\n\n*Impact* +\nUse the bundled JDK (preferable), or set `ES_JAVA_HOME`. `JAVA_HOME` will be\nignored.\n====\n"
