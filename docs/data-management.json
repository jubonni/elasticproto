Elastic will work to fix any issues, but this feature is not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.\"]\n\n**{ilm-init}** can be used to manage both indices and data streams and it allows you to:\n\n* Define the retention period of your data. The retention period is the minimum time your data will be stored in {es}.\nData older than this period can be deleted by {es}.\n* Define <<data-tiers, multiple tiers>> of data nodes with different performance characteristics.\n* Automatically transition indices through the data tiers according to your performance needs and retention policies.\n* Leverage <<searchable-snapshots, searchable snapshots>> stored in a remote repository to provide resiliency\nfor your older indices while reducing operating costs and maintaining search performance.\n* Perform <<async-search-intro, asynchronous searches>> of data stored on less-performant hardware.\n\n**Data stream lifecycle** is less feature rich but is focused on simplicity, so it allows you to easily:\n\n* Define the retention period of your data. The retention period is the minimum time your data will be stored in {es}.\nData older than this period can be deleted by {es} at a later time.\n* Improve the performance of your data stream by performing background operations that will optimise the way your data\nstream is stored.\n--\n\ninclude::ilm/index.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::datatiers.asciidoc[]\n"
