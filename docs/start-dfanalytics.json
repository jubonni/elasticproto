The `index.number_of_shards` and\n`index.number_of_replicas` settings for the destination index are copied from\nthe source index. If there are multiple source indices, the destination index\ncopies the highest setting values. The mappings for the destination index are\nalso copied from the source indices. If there are any mapping conflicts, the job\nfails to start.\n\nIf the destination index exists, it is used as is. You can therefore set up the\ndestination index in advance with custom settings and mappings.\n\nIMPORTANT: When {es} {security-features} are enabled, the {dfanalytics-job}\nremembers which user created it and runs the job using those credentials.
