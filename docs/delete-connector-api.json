These need to be removed manually.\n\nTo get started with Connector APIs, check out <<es-connectors-tutorial-api, our tutorial>>.\n\n\n[[delete-connector-api-request]]\n==== {api-request-title}\n\n`DELETE _connector/<connector_id>`\n\n[[delete-connector-api-prereq]]\n==== {api-prereq-title}\n\n* To sync data using self-managed connectors, you need to deploy the <<es-connectors-deploy-connector-service,Elastic connector service>>. on your own infrastructure. This service runs automatically on Elastic Cloud for Elastic managed connectors.\n* The `connector_id` parameter should reference an existing connector.\n\n[[delete-connector-api-path-params]]\n==== {api-path-parms-title}\n\n`<connector_id>`::\n(Required, string)\n\n`delete_sync_jobs`::\n(Optional, boolean) A flag indicating if associated sync jobs should be also removed.
