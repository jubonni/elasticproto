If the highest possible accuracy is desired, or it's crucial to produce exactly the same results as in previous versions, one can either set `execution_hint` to `high_accuracy` in the `tdigest` spec of a given percentile calculation, or set `search.aggs.tdigest_execution_hint` to `high_accuracy` in cluster settings to apply to all percentile queries.\n====\n\n"
