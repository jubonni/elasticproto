Make\nsure that the number of threads that the Elasticsearch user can create is at\nleast 4096.\n\nThis can be done by setting <<ulimit,`ulimit -u 4096`>> as root before\nstarting Elasticsearch, or by setting `nproc` to `4096` in\n<<limits.conf,`/etc/security/limits.conf`>>.\n\nThe package distributions when run as services under `systemd` will configure\nthe number of threads for the Elasticsearch process automatically. No\nadditional configuration is required.\n"
