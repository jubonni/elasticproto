By default, anonymous requests are rejected and an authentication error is returned (status code `401`). \n\nTo enable anonymous access, you assign one or more roles to anonymous\nusers in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. For example, the following\nconfiguration assigns anonymous users `role1` and `role2`:\n\n[source,yaml]\n----------------------------------------\nxpack.security.authc:\n  anonymous:\n    username: anonymous_user <1>\n    roles: role1, role2 <2>\n    authz_exception: true <3>\n----------------------------------------\n<1> The username/principal of the anonymous user. Defaults to \n`_es_anonymous_user` if not specified.\n<2> The roles to associate with the anonymous user. If no roles are specified, anonymous access is disabled--anonymous requests will be rejected and return an authentication error.\n<3> When `true`, a 403 HTTP status code is returned if the anonymous user\ndoes not have the permissions needed to perform the requested action and the\nuser will NOT be prompted to provide credentials to access the requested \nresource. When `false`, a 401 HTTP status code is returned if the anonymous user\ndoes not have the necessary permissions and the user is prompted for \ncredentials to access the requested resource. If you are using anonymous access \nin combination with HTTP, you might need to set `authz_exception` to `false` \nif your client does not support preemptive basic authentication. Defaults to \n`true`."
