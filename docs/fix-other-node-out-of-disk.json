If one or more of these nodes are running out of space, you need to ensure that they have\nenough disk space to function. If the <<health-api, health API>> reports that a node that is not a master and does not\ncontain data is out of space you need to increase the disk capacity of this node.\n\ninclude::{es-ref-dir}/tab-widgets/troubleshooting/disk/increase-other-node-capacity-widget.asciidoc[]\n"
