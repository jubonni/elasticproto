However,\nsince {watcher} stores its watches in the `.watches` index, you can list them\nby executing a search on this index.\n\nIMPORTANT:\tYou can only perform read actions on the `.watches` index. You must\n            use the {watcher} APIs to create, update, and delete watches. If {es}\n            {security-features} are enabled, we recommend you only grant users\n            `read` privileges on the `.watches` index.\n\nFor example, the following returns the first 100 watches:\n\n[source,console]\n--------------------------------------------------\nGET /_watcher/_query/watches\n{\n  \"size\" : 100\n}\n--------------------------------------------------\n"
