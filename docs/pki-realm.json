In this scenario, clients connecting directly to {es} must\npresent X.509 certificates. First, the certificates must be accepted for\nauthentication on the SSL/TLS layer on {es}. Then they are optionally\nfurther validated by a PKI realm. See <<pki-realm-for-direct-clients>>.\n\nYou can also use PKI certificates to authenticate to {kib}, however this\nrequires some additional configuration. On {es}, this configuration enables {kib} \nto act as a proxy for SSL/TLS authentication and to submit the client\ncertificates to {es} for further validation by a PKI realm. See\n<<pki-realm-for-proxied-clients>>.\n\ninclude::configuring-pki-realm.asciidoc[]\n"
