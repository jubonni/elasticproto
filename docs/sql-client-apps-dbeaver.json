As an alternative one can add a local file instead if the {es} Maven repository is not an option.\n\nWhen changing the driver, make sure to click on the *Find Class* button at the bottom - the Driver class should be picked out automatically however this provides a sanity check that the driver jar is properly found and it is not corrupt.\n\n==== Test connectivity\n\nOnce the driver version and the settings are in place, use *Test Connection* to check that everything works. If things are okay, one should get a confirmation window with the version of the driver and that of {es-sql}:\n\nimage:images/sql/client-apps/dbeaver-5-test-conn.png[]\n\nClick *Finish* and the new {es} connection appears in the *Database Connection* panel.\n\nDBeaver is now configured to talk to {es}.\n\n==== Connect to {es}\n\nSimply click on the {es} connection and start querying and exploring {es}:\n\nimage:images/sql/client-apps/dbeaver-6-data.png[]\n"
