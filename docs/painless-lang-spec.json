As a direct comparison to Java, there are some important\ndifferences, especially related to the casting model. For more detailed\nconceptual information about the basic constructs that Painless and Java share,\nrefer to the corresponding topics in the\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/index.html[Java Language\nSpecification].\n\nPainless scripts are parsed and compiled using the https://www.antlr.org/[ANTLR4]\nand https://asm.ow2.org/[ASM] libraries. Scripts are compiled directly\ninto Java Virtual Machine (JVM) byte code and executed against a standard JVM.\nThis specification uses ANTLR4 grammar notation to describe the allowed syntax.\nHowever, the actual Painless grammar is more compact than what is shown here.\n\ninclude::painless-lang-spec/index.asciidoc[]\n"
