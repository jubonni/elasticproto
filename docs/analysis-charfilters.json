For\ninstance, a character filter could be used to convert Hindu-Arabic numerals\n(\u0660\u200e\u0661\u0662\u0663\u0664\u0665\u0666\u0667\u0668\u200e\u0669\u200e) into their Arabic-Latin equivalents (0123456789), or to strip HTML\nelements like `<b>` from the stream.\n\n\nElasticsearch has a number of built in character filters which can be used to build\n<<analysis-custom-analyzer,custom analyzers>>.\n\n<<analysis-htmlstrip-charfilter,HTML Strip Character Filter>>::\n\nThe `html_strip` character filter strips out HTML elements like `<b>` and\ndecodes HTML entities like `&amp;`.\n\n<<analysis-mapping-charfilter,Mapping Character Filter>>::\n\nThe `mapping` character filter replaces any occurrences of the specified\nstrings with the specified replacements.\n\n<<analysis-pattern-replace-charfilter,Pattern Replace Character Filter>>::\n\nThe `pattern_replace` character filter replaces any characters matching a\nregular expression with the specified replacement.\n\ninclude::charfilters/htmlstrip-charfilter.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::charfilters/mapping-charfilter.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::charfilters/pattern-replace-charfilter.asciidoc[]\n"
