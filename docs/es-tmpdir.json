This behavior can lead to\nthe private temporary directory being removed while {es} is running if\nfeatures that require the temporary directory are not used for a long time.\nRemoving the private temporary directory causes problems if a feature that\nrequires this directory is subsequently used.\n\nIf you install {es} using the `.deb` or `.rpm` packages and run it\nunder `systemd`, the private temporary directory that {es} uses\nis excluded from periodic cleanup.\n\nIf you intend to run the `.tar.gz` distribution on Linux or MacOS for\nan extended period, consider creating a dedicated temporary\ndirectory for {es} that is not under a path that will have old files\nand directories cleaned from it. This directory should have permissions set\nso that only the user that {es} runs as can access it. Then, set the\n`$ES_TMPDIR` environment variable to point to this directory before starting\n{es}.\n"
