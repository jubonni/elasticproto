However, this API\nimposes a heavy load on the elected master node and may not always have the expected effect. Calling this API should\nnever be necessary. Consider instead <<shards-rebalancing-heuristics,increasing the value of\n`cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold`>> to avoid excessive shard movements.\n\n[[delete-desired-balance-request]]\n==== {api-request-title}\n\n[source,console]\n--------------------------------------------------\nDELETE /_internal/desired_balance\n--------------------------------------------------\n// TEST[skip:Can't reliably test desired balance]\n"
