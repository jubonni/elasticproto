For\nexample, `*` in the `hours` field means \"every hour\".\n\n`?`::                \nNo specific value. Use when you don't care what the value\nis. For example, if you want the schedule to trigger on a\nparticular day of the month, but don't care what day of\nthe week that happens to be, you can specify `?` in the\n`day_of_week` field.\n\n`-`::                 \nA range of values (inclusive). Use to separate a minimum\nand maximum value. For example, if you want the schedule\nto trigger every hour between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., you\ncould specify `9-17` in the `hours` field.\n\n`,`::\nMultiple values. Use to separate multiple values for a\nfield. For example, if you want the schedule to trigger\nevery Tuesday and Thursday, you could specify `TUE,THU`\nin the `day_of_week` field.\n\n`/`::\nIncrement. Use to separate values when specifying a time\nincrement. The first value represents the starting point,\nand the second value represents the interval. For example,\nif you want the schedule to trigger every 20 minutes\nstarting at the top of the hour, you could specify `0/20`\nin the `minutes` field. Similarly, specifying `1/5` in\n`day_of_month` field will trigger every 5 days starting on\nthe first day of the month.\n\n`L`::\nLast. Use in the `day_of_month` field to mean the last day\nof the month--day 31 for January, day 28 for February in\nnon-leap years, day 30 for April, and so on. Use alone in\nthe `day_of_week` field in place of `7` or `SAT`, or after\na particular day of the week to select the last day of that\ntype in the month. For example `6L` means the last Friday\nof the month. You can specify `LW` in the `day_of_month`\nfield to specify the last weekday of the month. Avoid using\nthe `L` option when specifying lists or ranges of values,\nas the results likely won't be what you expect.\n\n`W`::\nWeekday. Use to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest\nthe given day. As an example, if you specify `15W` in the\n`day_of_month` field and the 15th is a Saturday, the\nschedule will trigger on the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday,\nthe schedule will trigger on Monday the 16th. If the 15th\nis a Tuesday, the schedule will trigger on Tuesday the 15th.\nHowever if you specify `1W` as the value for `day_of_month`,\nand the 1st is a Saturday, the schedule will trigger on\nMonday the 3rd--it won't jump over the month boundary. You\ncan specify `LW` in the `day_of_month` field to specify the\nlast weekday of the month. You can only use the `W` option\nwhen the `day_of_month` is a single day--it is not valid\nwhen specifying a range or list of days.\n\n`#`::\nNth XXX day in a month. Use in the `day_of_week` field to\nspecify the nth XXX day of the month. For example, if you\nspecify `6#1`, the schedule will trigger on the first\nFriday of the month. Note that if you specify `3#5` and\nthere are not 5 Tuesdays in a particular month, the\nschedule won't trigger that month.\n\n[discrete]\n[[cron-expression-examples]]\n==== Examples\n\n[discrete]\n[[cron-example-daily]]\n===== Setting daily triggers\n\n`0 5 9 * * ?`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC every day.\n\n`0 5 9 * * ? 2020`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC every day during the year 2020.\n\n[discrete]\n[[cron-example-range]]\n===== Restricting triggers to a range of days or times\n\n`0 5 9 ? * MON-FRI`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC Monday through Friday.\n\n`0 0-5 9 * * ?`::\nTrigger every minute starting at 9:00 a.m. UTC and ending at 9:05 a.m. UTC every day.\n\n[discrete]\n[[cron-example-interval]]\n===== Setting interval triggers\n\n`0 0/15 9 * * ?`::\nTrigger every 15 minutes starting at 9:00 a.m. UTC and ending at 9:45 a.m. UTC every day.\n\n`0 5 9 1/3 * ?`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC every 3 days every month, starting on the first day of the month.\n\n[discrete]\n[[cron-example-day]]\n===== Setting schedules that trigger on a particular day\n\n`0 1 4 1 4 ?`::\nTrigger every April 1st at 4:01 a.m. UTC.\n`0 0,30 9 ? 4 WED`::\nTrigger at 9:00 a.m. UTC and at 9:30 a.m. UTC every Wednesday in the month of April.\n\n`0 5 9 15 * ?`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC on the 15th day of every month.\n\n`0 5 9 15W * ?`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC on the nearest weekday to the 15th of every month.\n\n`0 5 9 ? * 6#1`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC on the first Friday of every month.\n\n[discrete]\n[[cron-example-last]]\n===== Setting triggers using last\n\n`0 5 9 L * ?`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC on the last day of every month.\n\n`0 5 9 ? * 2L`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC on the last Monday of every month.\n\n`0 5 9 LW * ?`::\nTrigger at 9:05 a.m. UTC on the last weekday of every month.\n"
