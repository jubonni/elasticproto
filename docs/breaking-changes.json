For more information about what's new in this\nrelease, see the <<release-highlights>> and <<es-release-notes>>.\n\nAs {es} introduces new features and improves existing ones, the changes\nsometimes make older settings, APIs, and parameters obsolete. We typically\ndeprecate obsolete functionality as part of a release. If possible, we support\nthe deprecated functionality for several subsequent releases before removing it.\nThis enables applications to continue working unchanged while you prepare to\nmigrate away from the deprecated functionality.\n\nTo get the most out of {es} and facilitate future upgrades, we strongly\nencourage migrating away from using deprecated functionality as soon as\npossible.\n\nTo give you insight into what deprecated features you're using, {es}:\n\n- Returns a `Warn` HTTP header whenever you\nsubmit a request that uses deprecated functionality.\n- <<deprecation-logging, Logs deprecation warnings>> when\ndeprecated functionality is used.\n- <<migration-api-deprecation, Provides a deprecation info API>>\nthat scans a cluster's configuration\nand mappings for deprecated functionality.\n\nFor more information about {minor-version},\nsee the <<release-highlights>> and <<es-release-notes>>.\nFor information about how to upgrade your cluster, see <<setup-upgrade>>.\n"
