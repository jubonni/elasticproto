This can be \nachieved by increasing the number of replica shards up to the maximum value\n(total number of nodes minus one) which also serves the purpose to protect\nagainst hardware failure. If the index has a preferred tier, Elasticsearch will\nonly place the copies of the data for that index on nodes in the target tier.\n\nIf a warning is encountered with not enough nodes to allocate all shard \nreplicas, you can influence this behavior by adding more nodes to the cluster\n(or tier if tiers are in use), or by reducing the\n<<dynamic-index-number-of-replicas,`index.number_of_replicas`>> index setting.\n\nIn order to fix this follow the next steps:\n\ninclude::{es-ref-dir}/tab-widgets/troubleshooting/data/increase-tier-capacity-widget.asciidoc[]\n\n\n\n"
