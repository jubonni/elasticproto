Continuous failures of automated\nsnapshots can leave a deployment without recovery options in cases of data loss or outages.\n\nElasticsearch keeps track of the number of repeated failures when executing automated snapshots. If an automated\nsnapshot fails too many times without a successful execution, the health API will report a warning. The number of\nrepeated failures before reporting a warning is controlled by the\n<<slm-health-failed-snapshot-warn-threshold,`slm.health.failed_snapshot_warn_threshold`>> setting.\n\nIn the event that an automated {slm} policy execution is experiencing repeated failures, follow these steps to get more\ninformation about the problem:\n\ninclude::{es-ref-dir}/tab-widgets/troubleshooting/snapshot/repeated-snapshot-failures-widget.asciidoc[]\n\n\n\n"
