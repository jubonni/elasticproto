There are\nsituations where a search executes on many shards, possibly against\nlarge data sets or multiple <<remote-clusters,remote clusters>>, for which\nresults are not expected to be returned in milliseconds. When you need to\nexecute long-running searches, synchronously\nwaiting for its results to be returned is not ideal. Instead, Async search lets\nyou submit a search request that gets executed _asynchronously_,\nmonitor the progress of the request, and retrieve results at a later stage.\nYou can also retrieve partial results as they become available but\nbefore the search has completed.\n\nYou can submit an async search request using the <<submit-async-search,submit\nasync search>> API. The <<get-async-search,get async search>> API allows you to\nmonitor the progress of an async search request and retrieve its results. An\nongoing async search can be deleted through the <<delete-async-search,delete\nasync search>> API.\n"
