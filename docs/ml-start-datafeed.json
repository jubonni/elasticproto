Otherwise, an\nerror occurs.\n* Requires the `manage_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the \n`machine_learning_admin` built-in role.\n\n[[ml-start-datafeed-desc]]\n== {api-description-title}\n\nA {dfeed} must be started in order to retrieve data from {es}.\nA {dfeed} can be started and stopped multiple times throughout its lifecycle.\n\nIf you restart a stopped {dfeed}, by default it continues processing input data\nfrom the next millisecond after it was stopped. If new data was indexed for that\nexact millisecond between stopping and starting, it will be ignored.\n\nIMPORTANT: When {es} {security-features} are enabled, your {dfeed} remembers\nwhich roles the last user to create or update it had at the time of\ncreation/update and runs the query using those same roles. If you provided\n<<http-clients-secondary-authorization,secondary authorization headers>> when\nyou created or updated the {dfeed}, those credentials are used instead.\n\n[[ml-start-datafeed-path-parms]]\n== {api-path-parms-title}\n\n`<feed_id>`::\n(Required, string)\ninclude::{es-ref-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=datafeed-id]\n\n[[ml-start-datafeed-query-parms]]\n== {api-query-parms-title}\n\n`end`::\n(Optional, string) The time that the {dfeed} should end, which can be\nspecified by using one of the following formats:\n+\n--\n* ISO 8601 format with milliseconds, for example `2017-01-22T06:00:00.000Z`\n* ISO 8601 format without milliseconds, for example `2017-01-22T06:00:00+00:00`\n* Milliseconds since the epoch, for example `1485061200000`\n \nDate-time arguments using either of the ISO 8601 formats must have a time zone\ndesignator, where `Z` is accepted as an abbreviation for UTC time.\n  \nNOTE: When a URL is expected (for example, in browsers), the `+` used in time\nzone designators must be encoded as `%2B`.\n  \nThis value is exclusive. If you do not specify an end time, the {dfeed} runs\ncontinuously.\n--\n\n`start`::\n(Optional, string) The time that the {dfeed} should begin, which can be\nspecified by using the same formats as the `end` parameter.
