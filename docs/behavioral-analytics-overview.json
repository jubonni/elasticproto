Elastic plans to promote this feature to GA in a future release.\n====\n\n.*Expand to learn about version history*\n[%collapsible]\n====\n* Behavioral Analytics was introduced in Elastic *8.7.0* to the Enterprise Search service.\n* There was a breaking schema change in *8.8.0*.\n(See {enterprise-search-ref}/analytics-migration.html[Migrating from 8.7 to 8.8] in the Search documentation if you're upgrading from 8.7 to 8.8.)\n* The feature was moved to Elasticsearch in *8.10*, meaning the Enterprise Search service is no longer required as of 8.10.\n====\n\nAnalytics are available to all Elastic Cloud users.\n\nAnalytics are also available to *self-managed* deployments that satisfy subscription requirements.\nView the requirements for this feature under the *Elastic Search* section of the https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Elastic Stack subscriptions^] page.\n\nYour Elastic deployment must include the {es} and {kib}services.\n\n[discrete]\n[[behavioral-analytics-overview-docs]]\n=== Documentation\n\nThe following documentation is available in the {es} docs:\n\n* <<behavioral-analytics-start>>\n* <<behavioral-analytics-api>>\n* <<behavioral-analytics-cors>>\n* <<behavioral-analytics-event>>\n* <<behavioral-analytics-event-reference>>\n\nAdditional documentation is available in the following places:\n\n* The https://github.com/elastic/behavioral-analytics-tracker/tree/main#readme[Behavioral Analytics Tracker Mono Repo^] contains the source code for the Behavioral Analytics Tracker, which can be embedded using either the JavaScript or Browser trackers:\n** Read the https://github.com/elastic/behavioral-analytics-tracker/blob/main/packages/javascript-tracker/README.md[JavaScript tracker README^].\n** Read the https://github.com/elastic/behavioral-analytics-tracker/blob/main/packages/browser-tracker/README.md[Browser tracker README^].\n* The Search UI documentation contains information about the https://docs.elastic.co/search-ui/api/core/plugins/analytics-plugin[Search UI Analytics Plugin^].\n* Behavioral Analytics uses a number of <<behavioral-analytics-apis, APIs>> to manage analytics collections.\n\n[NOTE]\n.GDPR compliance\n====\n\nUsers may be concerned about the privacy implications of analytics data collection.\nBehavioral Analytics is fully GDPR compliant, because no personal data are collected.\n\nTo integrate the behavioral analytics client, session data are stored in two tokens:\n\n* *User Token*. A unique identifier for the user.\nStored under `EA_UID` cookie. Default time length is 24 hours from the first time the user visits the site.\n\n* *Session Token*. A unique identifier for the session.\nStored under `EA_SID` cookie. Time length is 30 minutes from the last time the user visits the site.\n\nThese tokens enable the client to identify a user across sessions.\nThey do not collect sensitive information, such as IP addresses or location data, or any other personal data.\n====\n\ninclude::behavioral-analytics-start.asciidoc[]\ninclude::behavioral-analytics-cors.asciidoc[]\ninclude::behavioral-analytics-event.asciidoc[]\ninclude::behavioral-analytics-event-reference.asciidoc[]\ninclude::behavioral-analytics-api.asciidoc[]\n"
