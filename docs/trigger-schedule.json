All times are specified in UTC time.\n\n{watcher} uses the system clock to determine the current time. To ensure schedules\nare triggered when expected, you should synchronize the clocks of all nodes in the\ncluster using a time service such as http://www.ntp.org/[NTP].\n\nKeep in mind that the throttle period can affect when a watch is actually executed.\nThe default throttle period is five seconds (5000 ms). If you configure a schedule\nthat's more frequent than the throttle period, the throttle period overrides the\nschedule. For example, if you set the throttle period to one minute (60000 ms)\nand set the schedule to every 10 seconds, the watch is executed no more than\nonce per minute. For more information about throttling, see\n<<actions-ack-throttle>>.\n\n{watcher} provides several types of schedule triggers:\n\n* <<schedule-hourly, `hourly`>>\n* <<schedule-daily, `daily`>>\n* <<schedule-weekly, `weekly`>>\n* <<schedule-monthly, `monthly`>>\n* <<schedule-yearly, `yearly`>>\n* <<schedule-cron, `cron`>>\n* <<schedule-interval, `interval`>>\n\ninclude::schedule/hourly.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::schedule/daily.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::schedule/weekly.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::schedule/monthly.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::schedule/yearly.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::schedule/cron.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::schedule/interval.asciidoc[]\n"
