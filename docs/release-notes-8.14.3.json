This issue is fixed in 8.15.0.\n\n[[bug-8.14.3]]\n[float]\n=== Bug fixes\n\nCluster Coordination::\n* Ensure tasks preserve versions in `MasterService` {es-pull}109850[#109850]\n\nES|QL::\n* Introduce compute listener {es-pull}110400[#110400]\n\nMapping::\n* Automatically adjust `ignore_malformed` only for the @timestamp {es-pull}109948[#109948]\n\nTSDB::\n* Disallow index.time_series.end_time setting from being set or updated in normal indices {es-pull}110268[#110268] (issue: {es-issue}110265[#110265])\n\n\n"
