This means that the binary file sent to Elasticsearch will not be retained.\n\n*Impact* +\nUsers should update the \"remove_binary\" option to be explicitly true or false, instead of relying on the default value, so that no default value changes will affect Elasticsearch.\n====\n\n[discrete]\n[[deprecations_86_cluster_and_node_setting]]\n==== Cluster and node setting deprecations\n\n[[ensure_balance_threshold_at_least_1]]\n.Ensure balance threshold is at least 1\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\nValues for `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold` smaller than `1` are now ignored. Support for values less than `1` for this setting is deprecated and will be forbidden in a future version.\n\n*Impact* +\nSet `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold` to be at least `1`.\n====\n\n[discrete]\n[[deprecations_86_mapping]]\n==== Mapping deprecations\n\n[[deprecate_silently_ignoring_type_fields_copy_to_boost_in_metadata_field_definition]]\n.Deprecate silently ignoring type, fields, copy_to and boost in metadata field definition\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\nUnsupported parameters like type, fields, copy_to and boost are silently ignored when provided as part of the configuration of a metadata field in the index mappings. They will cause a deprecation warning when used in the mappings for indices that are created from 8.6 onwards.\n\n*Impact* +\nTo resolve the deprecation warning, remove the mention of type, fields, copy_to or boost from any metadata field definition as part of index mappings. They take no effect so removing them won't have any impact besides resolving the deprecation warning.\n====\n\n[discrete]\n[[deprecations_86_rest_api]]\n==== REST API deprecations\n\n[[state_field_deprecated_in_cluster_reroute_response]]\n.state field is deprecated in /_cluster/reroute response\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\n`state` field is deprecated in `/_cluster/reroute` response. Cluster state does not provide meaningful information\nabout the result of reroute/commands execution. There are no guarantees that this exact state would be applied.\n\n*Impact* +\nReroute API users should not rely on `state` field and instead use `explain` to request result of commands execution.\n====\n\n"
