The higher the\n`_score`, the more relevant the document. While each query type can calculate\nrelevance scores differently, score calculation also depends on whether the\nquery clause is run in a **query** or **filter** context.\n\n[discrete]\n[[query-context]]\n=== Query context\nIn the query context, a query clause answers the question ``__How well does this\ndocument match this query clause?__'' Besides deciding whether or not the\ndocument matches, the query clause also calculates a relevance score in the\n`_score` metadata field.\n\nQuery context is in effect whenever a query clause is passed to a `query`\nparameter, such as the `query` parameter in the\n<<request-body-search-query,search>> API.\n\n[discrete]\n[[filter-context]]\n=== Filter context\n\nA filter answers the binary question \u201cDoes this document match this query clause?\u201d. The answer is simply \"yes\" or \"no\".\nFiltering has several benefits:\n\n. *Simple binary logic*: In a filter context, a query clause determines document matches based on a yes/no criterion, without score calculation.\n. *Performance*: Because they don't compute relevance scores, filters execute faster than queries.\n. *Caching*: {es} automatically caches frequently used filters, speeding up subsequent search performance.\n. *Resource efficiency*: Filters consume less CPU resources compared to full-text queries.\n. *Query combination*: Filters can be combined with scored queries to refine result sets efficiently.\n\nFilters are particularly effective for querying structured data and implementing \"must have\" criteria in complex searches.\n\nStructured data refers to information that is highly organized and formatted in a predefined manner. In the context of Elasticsearch, this typically includes:\n\n* Numeric fields (integers, floating-point numbers)\n* Dates and timestamps\n* Boolean values\n* Keyword fields (exact match strings)\n* Geo-points and geo-shapes\n\nUnlike full-text fields, structured data has a consistent, predictable format, making it ideal for precise filtering operations.\n\nCommon filter applications include:\n\n* Date range checks: for example is the `timestamp` field between 2015 and 2016\n* Specific field value checks: for example is the `status` field equal to \"published\" or is the `author` field equal to \"John Doe\"\n\nFilter context applies when a query clause is passed to a `filter` parameter, such as:\n\n* `filter` or `must_not` parameters in <<query-dsl-bool-query,`bool`>>  queries\n* `filter` parameter in <<query-dsl-constant-score-query,`constant_score`>> queries\n* <<search-aggregations-bucket-filter-aggregation,`filter`>> aggregations\n\nFilters optimize query performance and efficiency, especially for structured data queries and when combined with full-text searches.\n\n[discrete]\n[[query-filter-context-ex]]\n=== Example of query and filter contexts\n\nBelow is an example of query clauses being used in query and filter context\nin the `search` API. This query will match documents where all of the following\nconditions are met:\n\n* The `title` field contains the word `search`.\n* The `content` field contains the word `elasticsearch`.\n* The `status` field contains the exact word `published`.\n* The `publish_date` field contains a date from 1 Jan 2015 onwards.\n\n[source,console]\n------------------------------------\nGET /_search\n{\n  \"query\": { <1>\n    \"bool\": { <2>\n      \"must\": [\n        { \"match\": { \"title\":   \"Search\"        }},\n        { \"match\": { \"content\": \"Elasticsearch\" }}  \n      ],\n      \"filter\": [ <3>\n        { \"term\":  { \"status\": \"published\" }}, \n        { \"range\": { \"publish_date\": { \"gte\": \"2015-01-01\" }}} \n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n------------------------------------\n\n<1> The `query` parameter indicates query context.\n<2> The `bool` and two `match` clauses are used in query context,\n    which means that they are used to score how well each document\n    matches.\n<3> The `filter` parameter indicates filter context. Its `term` and \n    `range` clauses are used in filter context. They will filter out \n    documents which do not match, but they will\n    not affect the score for matching documents.\n\nWARNING: Scores calculated for queries in query context are represented \nas single precision floating point numbers; they have only\n24 bits for significand's precision. Score calculations that exceed the\nsignificand's precision will be converted to floats with loss of precision.\n\nTIP: Use query clauses in query context for conditions which should affect the\nscore of matching documents (i.e. how well does the document match), and use\nall other query clauses in filter context.\n"
