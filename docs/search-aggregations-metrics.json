The values are typically extracted from the fields of the document (using the field data), but\ncan also be generated using scripts.\n\nNumeric metrics aggregations are a special type of metrics aggregation which output numeric values. Some aggregations output\na single numeric metric (e.g. `avg`) and are called `single-value numeric metrics aggregation`, others generate multiple\nmetrics (e.g. `stats`) and are called `multi-value numeric metrics aggregation`. The distinction between single-value and\nmulti-value numeric metrics aggregations plays a role when these aggregations serve as direct sub-aggregations of some\nbucket aggregations (some bucket aggregations enable you to sort the returned buckets based on the numeric metrics in each bucket).\n\ninclude::metrics/avg-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/boxplot-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/cardinality-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/extendedstats-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/geobounds-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/geocentroid-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/geoline-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/cartesian-bounds-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/cartesian-centroid-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/matrix-stats-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/max-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/median-absolute-deviation-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/min-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/percentile-rank-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/percentile-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/rate-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/scripted-metric-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/stats-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/string-stats-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/sum-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/t-test-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/tophits-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/top-metrics-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/valuecount-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::metrics/weighted-avg-aggregation.asciidoc[]\n"
