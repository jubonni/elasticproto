Only indices with an `index.mode` of\n<<time-series-mode,`time_series`>> support this setting. For more information,\nrefer to <<time-bound-indices>>.\n\n[[index-time-series-end-time]]\n`index.time_series.end_time`::\n(<<dynamic-index-settings,Dynamic>>, string) Latest `@timestamp`\nvalue (exclusive) accepted by the index. Only indices with an `index.mode` of\n`time_series` support this setting. For more information, refer to\n<<time-bound-indices>>.\n\n[[index-look-ahead-time]]\n`index.look_ahead_time`::\n(<<_static_index_settings,Static>>, <<time-units,time units>>)\nInterval used to calculate the `index.time_series.end_time` for a TSDS's write\nindex. Defaults to `30m` (30 minutes). Accepts `1m` (one minute) to `2h` (two\nhours). Only indices with an `index.mode` of `time_series` support this setting.\nFor more information, refer to <<tsds-look-ahead-time>>. Additionally this setting\ncan not be less than `time_series.poll_interval` cluster setting.\n\nNOTE: Increasing the `look_ahead_time` will also increase the amount of time {ilm-cap}\nwaits before being able to proceed with executing the actions that expect the\nindex to not receive any writes anymore. For more information, refer to <<time-bound-indices>>.\n\n[[index-look-back-time]]\n`index.look_back_time`::\n(<<_static_index_settings,Static>>, <<time-units,time units>>)\nInterval used to calculate the `index.time_series.start_time` for a TSDS's first\nbacking index when a tsdb data stream is created. Defaults to `2h` (2 hours).\nAccepts `1m` (one minute) to `7d` (seven days). Only indices with an `index.mode`\nof `time_series` support this setting. For more information,\nrefer to <<tsds-look-back-time>>.\n\n[[index-routing-path]] `index.routing_path`::\n(<<_static_index_settings,Static>>, string or array of strings) Plain `keyword`\nfields used to route documents in a TSDS to index shards. Supports wildcards\n(`*`). Only indices with an `index.mode` of `time_series` support this setting.\nDefaults to an empty list, except for data streams then defaults to the list\nof <<time-series-dimension,dimension fields>> with a `time_series_dimension`\nvalue of `true` defined in your component and index templates. For more\ninformation, refer to <<dimension-based-routing>>.\n\n[[index-mapping-dimension-fields-limit]]\n// tag::dimensions-limit[]\n`index.mapping.dimension_fields.limit`::\n(<<dynamic-index-settings,Dynamic>>, integer)\nMaximum number of <<time-series-dimension,time series dimensions>> for the\nindex. Defaults to `32768`.\n// end::dimensions-limit[]\n"
