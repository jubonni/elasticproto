This issue is fixed in 8.15.0.\n\n* The `pytorch_inference` process used to run Machine Learning models can consume large amounts of memory.\nIn environments where the available memory is limited, the OS Out of Memory Killer will kill the `pytorch_inference`\nprocess to reclaim memory. This can cause inference requests to fail.\nElasticsearch will automatically restart the `pytorch_inference` process\nafter it is killed up to four times in 24 hours.
