See\n<<defining-roles>>.\n\n* `ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch-users` defines the users and their hashed passwords for\n  the `file` realm. See <<file-realm>>.\n\n* `ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch-users_roles` defines the user roles assignment for the\n  `file` realm. See <<file-realm>>.\n\n* `ES_PATH_CONF/role_mapping.yml` defines the role assignments for a\n  Distinguished Name (DN) to a role. This allows for LDAP and Active Directory\n  groups and users and PKI users to be mapped to roles. See\n  <<mapping-roles>>.\n\n* `ES_PATH_CONF/log4j2.properties` contains audit information. See\n<<audit-log-output>>.\n\n[[security-files-location]]\n\nIMPORTANT:  Any files that the {security-features} use must be stored in the {es}\n            configuration directory. {es} runs with restricted permissions\n            and is only permitted to read from the locations configured in the\n            directory layout for enhanced security.\n\nSeveral of these files are in the YAML format. When you edit these files, be\naware that YAML is indentation-level sensitive and indentation errors can lead\nto configuration errors. Avoid the tab character to set indentation levels, or\nuse an editor that automatically expands tabs to spaces.\n\nBe careful to properly escape YAML constructs such as `:` or leading exclamation\npoints within quoted strings. Using the `|` or `>` characters to define block\nliterals instead of escaping the problematic characters can help avoid problems.\n"
