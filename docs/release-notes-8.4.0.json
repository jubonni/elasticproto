This means that {anomaly-jobs} cannot be managed using\n{kib}. This issue is fixed in 8.6.0.\n+\nIf you upgrade to 8.4 or 8.5 with such a {dfeed}, you need to\nwork around the problem by updating each {dfeed}'s authorization information\nusing https://support.elastic.dev/knowledge/view/b5a879db[these steps].\n// end::ml-pre-7-datafeeds-known-issue[]\n\n// tag::file-based-settings-deadlock-known-issue[]\n* Orchestrators which use a `settings.json` file to configure Elasticsearch may\nencounter deadlocks during master elections (issue: {es-issue}92812[#92812])\n+\nTo resolve the deadlock, remove the `settings.json` file and restart the\naffected node.\n// end::file-based-settings-deadlock-known-issue[]\n\ninclude::8.0.0.asciidoc[tag=jackson-filtering-bug]\n\n// tag::ingest-processor-log4j-cluster-instability-known-issue[]\n* When the {ref}/attachment.html[ingest attachment processor] is used, the\ninteraction of https://tika.apache.org/[Tika] with log4j 2.18.0 and higher\n(introduced in {es} 8.4.0) results in excessive logging. This logging is so\nexcessive that it can lead to cluster instability, to the point where the\ncluster is unusable and nodes must be restarted. (issue: {es-issue}91964[#91964]).\nThis issue is fixed in {es} 8.7.0 ({es-pull}93878[#93878])\n+\nTo resolve the issue, upgrade to 8.7.0 or higher.\n//
