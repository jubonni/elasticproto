Create search applications based on your\n{es} indices, build queries using search templates, and easily preview your\nresults directly in the Kibana Search UI.\n\ninclude::search-api.asciidoc[]\ninclude::knn-search.asciidoc[]\ninclude::semantic-search.asciidoc[]\ninclude::search-across-clusters.asciidoc[]\ninclude::search-with-synonyms.asciidoc[]\ninclude::search-application-overview.asciidoc[]\ninclude::behavioral-analytics/behavioral-analytics-overview.asciidoc[]\n"
