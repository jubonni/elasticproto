It can still be a breaking change if it is configured on the elasticsearch yml file, for example by changing the threadpool size `thread_pool.vectortile.size=8`'\n\n*Impact* +\nIn the case the threadpool appears on the yaml file, Elasticsearch will not start until those lines are removed.\n====\n\n[discrete]\n[[breaking_810_java_api_changes]]\n==== Java API changes\n\n[[change_pre_configured_cached_analyzer_components_to_use_indexversion_instead_of_version-highlight]]\n.Change pre-configured and cached analyzer components to use IndexVersion instead of Version\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\nThis PR changes the types used to obtain pre-configured components from Version to IndexVersion,\nwith corresponding changes to method names.\n\nPrior to 8.10, there is a one-to-one mapping between node version and index version, with corresponding constants\nin the IndexVersion class.\nStarting in 8.10, IndexVersion is versioned independently of node version, and will be a simple incrementing number.\nFor more information on how to use IndexVersion and other version types, please see the contributing guide.\n\n*Impact* +\nAnalysis components now take IndexVersion instead of Version\n====\n\n\n[discrete]\n[[deprecated-8.10]]\n=== Deprecations\n\nThe following functionality has been deprecated in {es} 8.10\nand will be removed in a future version.\nWhile this won't have an immediate impact on your applications,\nwe strongly encourage you to take the described steps to update your code\nafter upgrading to 8.10.\n\nTo find out if you are using any deprecated functionality,\nenable <<deprecation-logging, deprecation logging>>.\n\n[discrete]\n[[deprecations_810_authorization]]\n==== Authorization deprecations\n\n[[mark_apm_user_for_removal_in_future_major_release]]\n.Mark `apm_user` for removal in a future major release\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\nThe `apm_user` role has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.
