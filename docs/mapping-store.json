This means that the field can be queried, but the\noriginal field value cannot be retrieved.\n\nUsually this doesn't matter. The field value is already part of the\n<<mapping-source-field,`_source` field>>, which is stored by default. If you\nonly want to retrieve the value of a single field or of a few fields, instead\nof the whole `_source`, then this can be achieved with\n<<source-filtering,source filtering>>.\n\nIn certain situations it can make sense to `store` a field. For instance, if\nyou have a document with a `title`, a `date`, and a very large `content`\nfield, you may want to retrieve just the `title` and the `date` without having\nto extract those fields from a large `_source` field:\n\n[source,console]\n--------------------------------------------------\nPUT my-index-000001\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"title\": {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"store\": true <1>\n      },\n      \"date\": {\n        \"type\": \"date\",\n        \"store\": true <1>\n      },\n      \"content\": {\n        \"type\": \"text\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT my-index-000001/_doc/1\n{\n  \"title\":   \"Some short title\",\n  \"date\":    \"2015-01-01\",\n  \"content\": \"A very long content field...\"\n}\n\nGET my-index-000001/_search\n{\n  \"stored_fields\": [ \"title\", \"date\" ] <2>\n}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n<1> The `title` and `date` fields are stored.\n<2> This request will retrieve the values of the `title` and `date` fields.\n\n[NOTE]\n.Stored fields returned as arrays\n======================================\n\nFor consistency, stored fields are always returned as an _array_ because there\nis no way of knowing if the original field value was a single value, multiple\nvalues, or an empty array.\n\nIf you need the original value, you should retrieve it from the `_source`\nfield instead.\n\n======================================\n"
