A function is called multiple times in a single script\nto repeat its specific task. A parameter is a named type value available as a\n<<painless-variables, variable>> within the statement(s) of a function. A\nfunction specifies zero-to-many parameters, and when a function is called a\nvalue is specified per parameter. An argument is a value passed into a function\nat the point of call. A function specifies a return type value, though if the\ntype is <<void-type, void>> then no value is returned. Any non-void type return\nvalue is available for use within an <<painless-operators, operation>> or is\ndiscarded otherwise.\n\nYou can declare functions at the beginning of a Painless script, for example:\n\n[source,painless]\n---------------------------------------------------------\nboolean isNegative(def x) { x < 0 }\n...\nif (isNegative(someVar)) {\n  ...\n}\n---------------------------------------------------------"
