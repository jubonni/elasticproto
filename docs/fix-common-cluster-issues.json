These unassigned shards increase your risk of data loss and can\ndegrade cluster performance.\n\n<<rejected-requests,Rejected requests>>::\nWhen {es} rejects a request, it stops the operation and returns an error with a\n`429` response code.\n\n<<task-queue-backlog,Task queue backlog>>::\nA backlogged task queue can prevent tasks from completing and put the cluster\ninto an unhealthy state.\n\n<<diagnose-unassigned-shards,Diagnose unassigned shards>>::\nThere are multiple reasons why shards might get unassigned, ranging from \nmisconfigured allocation settings to lack of disk space.\n\n<<cluster-fault-detection-troubleshooting,Troubleshooting an unstable cluster>>::\nA cluster in which nodes leave unexpectedly is unstable and can create several \nissues.\n\n\n<<mapping-explosion,Mapping explosion>>::\nA cluster in which an index or index pattern as exploded with a high count of \nmapping fields which causes performance look-up issues for Elasticsearch and \nKibana.\n\n<<hotspotting,Hot spotting>>::\nHot spotting may occur in {es} when resource utilizations are unevenly\ndistributed across nodes.\n\n\ninclude::common-issues/disk-usage-exceeded.asciidoc[]\ninclude::common-issues/circuit-breaker-errors.asciidoc[]\ninclude::common-issues/high-cpu-usage.asciidoc[]\ninclude::common-issues/high-jvm-memory-pressure.asciidoc[]\ninclude::common-issues/red-yellow-cluster-status.asciidoc[]\ninclude::common-issues/rejected-requests.asciidoc[]\ninclude::common-issues/task-queue-backlog.asciidoc[]\ninclude::common-issues/mapping-explosion.asciidoc[]\ninclude::common-issues/hotspotting.asciidoc[]\ninclude::common-issues/diagnose-unassigned-shards.asciidoc[]\n\n"
