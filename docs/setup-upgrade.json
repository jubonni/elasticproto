Upgrading from a pre-release build to any\nother build is not supported, and can result in errors or silent data loss. If\nyou run a pre-release build for testing, discard the contents of the cluster\nbefore upgrading to another build of {es}.\nendif::[]\n\n{es} clusters can usually be upgraded one node at a time so upgrading does not\ninterrupt service. For upgrade instructions, refer to\n{stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html[Upgrading to Elastic {version}].\n\n.Upgrade from 7.x\nIMPORTANT: To upgrade to {version} from 7.16 or an earlier version, **you must\nfirst upgrade to {prev-major-last}**, even if you opt to do a full-cluster\nrestart instead of a rolling upgrade. This enables you to use the **Upgrade\nAssistant** to identify and resolve issues, reindex indices created before 7.0,\nand then perform a rolling upgrade. You must resolve all critical issues before\nproceeding with the upgrade. For instructions, refer to\n{stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html#prepare-to-upgrade[Prepare to upgrade\nfrom 7.x].\n\n[discrete]\n[[upgrade-index-compatibility]]\n=== Index compatibility\n\n{es} has full query and write support for indices created in the previous major\nversion. If you have indices created in 6.x or earlier, you might use the\n<<archive-indices,archive functionality>> to import them into newer {es}\nversions, or you must reindex or delete them before upgrading to {version}.\n{es} nodes will fail to start if incompatible indices are present.\nSnapshots of 6.x or earlier indices can only restored using the\n<<archive-indices,archive functionality>> to a 8.x cluster even if they\nwere created by a 7.x cluster.\nThe **Upgrade Assistant** in {prev-major-last} identifies any indices\nthat need to be reindexed or removed.\n\n[discrete]\n[[upgrade-rest-api-compatibility]]\n=== REST API compatibility\n\n<<rest-api-compatibility,REST API compatibility>> is a per-request opt-in\nfeature that can help REST clients mitigate non-compatible (breaking) changes to\nthe REST API.\n\n[discrete]\n[[upgrade-fips-java17]]\n=== FIPS Compliance and Java 17\n\ninclude::{es-ref-dir}/security/fips-java17.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::upgrade/archived-settings.asciidoc[]\n\ninclude::upgrade/archive-indices.asciidoc[]\n"
