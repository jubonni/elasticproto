Moreover, the rolled-over logs\nare also gzip compressed.\n\n*Impact* +\nThe names of rolled over audit log files (but not the name of the current log)\nhave changed.\nIf you've set up automated tools to consume these files, you must configure them\nto use the new names and to possibly account for `gzip` archives instead of\nplain text. The Docker build of {es} is not affected because it logs on `stdout`,\nwhere rollover is not performed.\n====\n"
