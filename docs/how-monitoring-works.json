If you want to alter how\nthese documents are structured or stored, refer to <<config-monitoring-indices>>.\n\nYou can use {agent} or {metricbeat} to collect monitoring data and to ship it\ndirectly to the monitoring cluster.\n\nTo learn how to collect monitoring data, refer to:\n\n* One of the following topics depending on how you want to collect monitoring\ndata from {es}:\n** <<configuring-elastic-agent>>: Uses a single agent to\ngather logs and metrics. Can be managed from a central location in {fleet}.\n** <<configuring-metricbeat>>: Uses a lightweight {beats}\nshipper to gather metrics. May be preferred if you have an existing investment\nin {beats} or are not yet ready to use {agent}.\n** <<collecting-monitoring-data>>: Uses internal exporters to\ngather metrics. Not recommended. If you have previously configured legacy\ncollection methods, you should migrate to using {agent} or {metricbeat}.\n* {kibana-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring {kib}]\n* {logstash-ref}/configuring-logstash.html[Monitoring {ls}]\n* {enterprise-search-ref}/monitoring.html[Monitoring {ents}]\n* Monitoring {beats}:\n** {auditbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[{auditbeat}]\n** {filebeat-ref}/monitoring.html[{filebeat}]\n** {heartbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[{heartbeat}]\n** {metricbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[{metricbeat}]\n** {packetbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[{packetbeat}]\n** {winlogbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[{winlogbeat}]\n* {apm-guide-ref}/monitor-apm.html[Monitoring APM Server]\n* {fleet-guide}/monitor-elastic-agent.html[Monitoring {agent}s]\n{fleet}-managed agents) or\n{fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-monitoring-configuration.html[Configure monitoring for standalone {agent}s]\n"
