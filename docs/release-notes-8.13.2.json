This issue is fixed in 8.15.0.\n\n* The `pytorch_inference` process used to run Machine Learning models can consume large amounts of memory.\nIn environments where the available memory is limited, the OS Out of Memory Killer will kill the `pytorch_inference`\nprocess to reclaim memory. This can cause inference requests to fail.\nElasticsearch will automatically restart the `pytorch_inference` process\nafter it is killed up to four times in 24 hours. (issue: {es-issue}110530[#110530])\n\n[[bug-8.13.2]]\n[float]\n\n* Searches involving nodes upgraded to 8.13.0 and a coordinator node that is running on version\n  8.12 or earlier can produce duplicate buckets when running `date_histogram` or `histogram`\n  aggregations. This can happen during a rolling upgrade to 8.13 or while running cross-cluster\n  searches.
