It was found that this filtering was not applied when\nrequests to {es} use certain deprecated `_xpack/security` URIs for APIs. The\nimpact of this flaw is that sensitive information, such as passwords and tokens,\nmight be printed in cleartext in {es} audit logs. Note that audit logging is\ndisabled by default and needs to be explicitly enabled. Even when audit logging\nis enabled, request bodies that could contain sensitive information are not\nprinted to the audit log unless explicitly configured.\n+\nThe issue is resolved in {es} 8.9.2.\n+\nFor more information, see our related\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/elasticsearch-8-9-2-and-7-17-13-security-update/342479[security\nannouncement].\n\n[[bug-8.9.2]]\n[float]\n=== Bug fixes\n\nData streams::\n* Avoid lifecycle NPE in the data stream lifecycle usage API {es-pull}98260[#98260]\n\nGeo::\n* Fix mvt error when returning partial results {es-pull}98765[#98765] (issue: {es-issue}98730[#98730])\n\nIngest Node::\n* Revert \"Add mappings for enrich fields\" {es-pull}98683[#98683]\n\n\n"
