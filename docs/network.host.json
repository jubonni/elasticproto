This is sufficient to run a cluster of one or more nodes on a single\nserver for development and testing, but a\n<<high-availability-cluster-design,resilient production cluster>> must involve\nnodes on other servers. There are many <<modules-network,network settings>> but\nusually all you need to configure is `network.host`:\n\n[source,yaml]\n--------------------------------------------------\nnetwork.host: 192.168.1.10\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIMPORTANT: When you provide a value for `network.host`, {es} assumes that you\nare moving from development mode to production mode, and upgrades a number of\nsystem startup checks from warnings to exceptions. See the differences between\n<<dev-vs-prod,development and production modes>>.\n"
