It signals that\nadditional storage capacity is necessary when existing capacity is less than the\npercentage multiplied by total data set size.\n\nThe frozen storage decider is enabled for all policies governing frozen data\nnodes and has no configuration options.\n\n[[autoscaling-frozen-storage-decider-settings]]\n==== Configuration settings\n\n`percentage`::\n(Optional, number value)\nPercentage of local storage relative to the data set size. Defaults to 5.\n"
