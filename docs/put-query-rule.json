{api-request-body-title}\n\n`type`::\n(Required, string) The type of rule.\nAt this time the following query rule types are allowed:\n\n- `pinned` will identify and pin specific documents to the top of search results.\n- `exclude` will exclude specific documents from search results.\n\n`criteria`::\n(Required, array of objects) The criteria that must be met for the rule to be applied.\nIf multiple criteria are specified for a rule, all criteria must be met for the rule to be applied.\n\nCriteria must have the following information:\n\n- `type` (Required, string) The type of criteria.\nThe following criteria types are supported:\n+\n--\n- `exact`\nOnly exact matches meet the criteria defined by the rule.\nApplicable for string or numerical values.\n- `fuzzy`\nExact matches or matches within the allowed {wikipedia}/Levenshtein_distance[Levenshtein Edit Distance] meet the criteria defined by the rule.\nOnly applicable for string values.\n- `prefix`\nMatches that start with this value meet the criteria defined by the rule.\nOnly applicable for string values.\n- `suffix`\nMatches that end with this value meet the criteria defined by the rule.\nOnly applicable for string values.\n- `contains`\nMatches that contain this value anywhere in the field meet the criteria defined by the rule.\nOnly applicable for string values.\n- `lt`\nMatches with a value less than this value meet the criteria defined by the rule.\nOnly applicable for numerical values.\n- `lte`\nMatches with a value less than or equal to this value meet the criteria defined by the rule.\nOnly applicable for numerical values.\n- `gt`\nMatches with a value greater than this value meet the criteria defined by the rule.\nOnly applicable for numerical values.\n- `gte`\nMatches with a value greater than or equal to this value meet the criteria defined by the rule.\nOnly applicable for numerical values.\n- `always`\nMatches all queries, regardless of input.\n--\n- `metadata` (Optional, string) The metadata field to match against.\nThis metadata will be used to match against `match_criteria` sent in the <<query-dsl-rule-query>>.\nRequired for all criteria types except `always`.\n- `values` (Optional, array of strings) The values to match against the metadata field.\nOnly one value must match for the criteria to be met.\nRequired for all criteria types except `always`.\n\n`actions`::\n(Required, object) The actions to take when the rule is matched.\nThe format of this action depends on the rule type.\n\nActions depend on the rule type.\nThe following actions are allowed for `pinned` or `exclude` rules:\n\n- `ids` (Optional, array of strings) The unique <<mapping-id-field, document IDs>> of the documents to apply the rule to.\nOnly one of `ids` or `docs` may be specified, and at least one must be specified.\n- `docs` (Optional, array of objects) The documents to apply the rule to.\nOnly one of `ids` or `docs` may be specified, and at least one must be specified.\nThere is a maximum value of 100 documents in a rule.\nYou can specify the following attributes for each document:\n+\n--\n- `_index` (Required, string) The index of the document.\nIf null, all documents with the specified `_id` will be affected across all searched indices.\n- `_id` (Required, string) The unique <<mapping-id-field, document ID>>.\n--\n\nIMPORTANT: Due to limitations within <<query-dsl-pinned-query,Pinned queries>>, you can only pin documents using `ids` or `docs`, but cannot use both in single rule.\nIt is advised to use one or the other in query rulesets, to avoid errors.\nAdditionally, pinned queries have a maximum limit of 100 pinned hits.\nIf multiple matching rules pin more than 100 documents, only the first 100 documents are pinned in the order they are specified in the ruleset.\n\n[[put-query-rule-example]]\n==== {api-examples-title}\n\nThe following example creates a new query rule with the ID `my-rule1` in a query ruleset called `my-ruleset`.\n\n- `my-rule1` will select documents to promote with IDs `id1` and `id2` when `user_query` contains `pugs` _or_ `puggles` **and** `user_country` exactly matches `us`.\n\n[source,console]\n----\nPUT _query_rules/my-ruleset/_rule/my-rule1\n{\n    \"type\": \"pinned\",\n    \"criteria\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"contains\",\n
