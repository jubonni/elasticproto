The `_id` can either be assigned at\nindexing time, or a unique `_id` can be generated by {es}. This field is not\nconfigurable in the mappings.\n\nThe value of the `_id` field is accessible in queries such as `term`,\n`terms`, `match`, and `query_string`.\n\n[source,console]\n--------------------------\n# Example documents\nPUT my-index-000001/_doc/1\n{\n  \"text\": \"Document with ID 1\"\n}\n\nPUT my-index-000001/_doc/2?refresh=true\n{\n  \"text\": \"Document with ID 2\"\n}\n\nGET my-index-000001/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"terms\": {\n      \"_id\": [ \"1\", \"2\" ] <1>\n    }\n  }\n}\n--------------------------\n\n<1> Querying on the `_id` field (also see the <<query-dsl-ids-query,`ids` query>>)\n\nThe `_id` field is restricted from use in aggregations, sorting, and scripting.\nIn case sorting or aggregating on the `_id` field is required, it is advised to\nduplicate the content of the `_id` field into another field that has\n`doc_values` enabled.\n\n[NOTE]\n==================================================\n`_id` is limited to 512 bytes in size and larger values will be rejected.\n==================================================\n"
