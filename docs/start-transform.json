The `number_of_shards` is set to `1` and the\n`auto_expand_replicas` is set to `0-1`.\n\nIf it is a pivot {transform}, it deduces the mapping definitions for the\ndestination index from the source indices and the transform aggregations. If\nfields in the destination index are derived from scripts (as in the case of\n`scripted_metric` or `bucket_script` aggregations), the {transform} uses\n<<dynamic-mapping,dynamic mappings>> unless an index template exists.\n\nIf it is a latest {transform}, it does not deduce mapping definitions; it uses\ndynamic mappings.\n\nTIP: To use explicit mappings, create the destination index before you start the\n{transform}. Alternatively, you can create an index template, though it does not\naffect the deduced mappings in a pivot {transform}.\n\nWhen the {transform} starts, a series of validations occur to ensure\nits success. If you deferred validation when you created the\n{transform}, they occur when you start the {transform}--with the\nexception of privilege checks. When {es} {security-features} are enabled, the\n{transform} remembers which roles the user that created it had at the\ntime of creation and uses those same roles. If those roles do not have the\nrequired privileges on the source and destination indices, the\n{transform} fails when it attempts unauthorized operations.\n\n[[start-transform-path-parms]]\n== {api-path-parms-title}\n\n`<transform_id>`::\n(Required, string)\nIdentifier for the {transform}.\n\n[[start-transform-query-parms]]\n== {api-query-parms-title}\n\n`from`::\n(Optional, string) Restricts the set of transformed entities to those changed\n after this time.
