Before upgrading to 8.5, review these changes and\ntake the described steps to mitigate the impact.\n\n[discrete]\n[[breaking_85_rest_api_changes]]\n==== REST API changes\n\n[[breaking_85_bulk_action_stricter]]\n.The bulk API now rejects requests containing unrecognized actions\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\nRequests to the bulk API comprise a sequence of items, each of which starts with\na JSON object describing the item. This object includes the type of action to\nperform with the item which should be one of `create`, `update`, `index`, or\n`delete`. Earlier versions of {es} had a bug that caused them to ignore items\nwith an unrecognized type, skipping the next line in the request, but this\nlenient behaviour meant that there is no way for the client to associate the\nitems in the response with the items in the request, and in some cases it would\ncause the remainder of the request to be parsed incorrectly.\n\nFrom version 8.5 onwards, requests to the bulk API must comprise only items\nwith recognized types. {es} will reject requests containing any items with an\nunrecognized type with a `400 Bad Request` error response.\n\nWe consider this change to be a bugfix but list it here as a breaking change\nsince it may affect the behaviour of applications which rely on being able to\nsend unrecognized actions to {es}.\n\n*Impact* +\nEnsure your application only sends items with type `create`, `update`, `index`\nor `delete` to the bulk API.\n====\n\n[discrete]\n[[deprecated-8.5]]\n=== Deprecations\n\nThe following functionality has been deprecated in {es} 8.5\nand will be removed in a future version.\nWhile this won't have an immediate impact on your applications,\nwe strongly encourage you to take the described steps to update your code\nafter upgrading to 8.5.\n\nTo find out if you are using any deprecated functionality,\nenable <<deprecation-logging, deprecation logging>>.\n\n\n[discrete]\n[[deprecations_85_plugins]]\n==== Plugin API deprecations\n\n[[network_plugins_deprecated]]\nPlugins that extend the NetworkPlugin interface are deprecated.\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\nPlugins may override funcionality that controls how nodes connect\nwith other nodes over TCP/IP. These plugins extend the NetworkPlugin\ninterface. In the next major release, these plugins will fail\nto install.\n\n*Impact* +\nDiscontinue using any plugins which extend NetworkPlugin. You can\nsee if any plugins use deprecated functionality by checking\nthe Elasticsearch deprecation log.\n====\n\n[[discoveryplugin_joinvalidator_and_election_strategies_deprecated]]\n.Extending DiscoveryPlugin to override join validators or election strategies is deprecated\n[%collapsible]\n====\n*Details* +\nPlugins that extend DiscoveryPlugin may override getJoinValidator and\ngetElectionStrategies. These methods are implementation details of the\nclustering mechanism within Elasticsearch. They should not be overriden.\nIn the next major release, plugins overriding getJoinValidator or\ngetElectionStrategies will fail to install.\n\n*Impact* +\nDiscontinue using any plugins that override getJoinValidator or\ngetElectionStrategies in DiscoveryPlugin. You can see if any plugins\nuse deprecated functionality by checking the Elasticsearch deprecation log.\n====\n\n"
