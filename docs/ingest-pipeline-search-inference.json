semantic similarity - as opposed to traditional word or text similarity.\n\nA common use case is a user searching FAQs, or a support agent searching a knowledge base, where semantically similar content may be indexed with little similarity in phrasing.\n\n[discrete#ingest-pipeline-search-inference-nlp-in-enterprise-search]\n==== NLP in Content UI\n\n[discrete#ingest-pipeline-search-inference-overview]\n===== Overview of ML inference pipeline\n\nThe diagram below shows how documents are processed during ingestion.\n\n// Original diagram: https://whimsical.com/ml-in-enterprise-search-ErCetPqrcCPu2QYHvAwrgP@2bsEvpTYSt1Hiuq6UBf68tUWvFiXdzLt6ao\nimage::images/ingest/document-enrichment-diagram.png[\"ML inference pipeline diagram\"]\n\n* Documents are processed by the `my-index-0001` pipeline, which happens automatically when indexing through a an Elastic connector or crawler.\n* The `_run_ml_inference` field is set to `true` to ensure the ML inference pipeline (`my-index-0001@ml-inference`) is executed.\n  This field is removed during the ingestion process.\n* The inference processor analyzes the `message` field on the document using the `my-positivity-model-id` trained model.\n  The inference output is stored in the `ml.inference.positivity_prediction` field.\n* The resulting enriched document is then indexed into the `my-index-0001` index.\n* The `ml.inference.positivity_prediction` field can now be used at query time to search for documents above or below a certain threshold.\n\n[discrete#ingest-pipeline-search-inference-find-deploy-manage-trained-models]\n==== Find, deploy, and manage trained models\n\nThis feature is intended to make it easier to use your ML trained models.\nFirst, you need to figure out which model works best for your data.\nMake sure to use a {ml-docs}/ml-nlp-model-ref.html[compatible third party NLP model^].\nSince these are publicly available, it is not possible to fine-tune models before {ml-docs}/ml-nlp-deploy-models.html[deploying them^].\n\nTrained models must be available in the current {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[Kibana Space^] and running in order to use them.\nBy default, models should be available in all Kibana Spaces that have the *Analytics* > *Machine Learning* feature enabled.\nTo manage your trained models, use the Kibana UI and navigate to *Stack Management -> Machine Learning -> Trained Models*.\nSpaces can be controlled in the **spaces** column.\nTo stop or start a model, go to the *Machine Learning* tab in the *Analytics* menu of Kibana and click *Trained Models* in the *Model Management* section.\n\n[NOTE]\n=========================\nThe `monitor_ml` <<security-privileges, Elasticsearch cluster privilege>> is required to manage ML models and ML inference pipelines which use those models.\n=========================\n\n[discrete#ingest-pipeline-search-inference-add-inference-processors]\n===== Add inference processors to your ML inference pipeline\n\nTo create the index-specific ML inference pipeline, go to *Search -> Content -> Indices -> <your index> -> Pipelines* in the Kibana UI.\n\nIf you only see the `ent-search-generic-ingestion` pipeline, you will need to click *Copy and customize* to create index-specific pipelines.\nThis will create the `{index_name}@ml-inference` pipeline.\n\nOnce your index-specific ML inference pipeline is ready, you can add inference processors that use your ML trained models.\nTo add an inference processor to the ML inference pipeline, click the *Add Inference Pipeline* button in the *Machine Learning Inference Pipelines* card.\n\n[role=\"screenshot\"]\nimage::images/ingest/document-enrichment-add-inference-pipeline.png[\"Add Inference Pipeline\"]\n\nHere, you'll be able to:\n\n1. Choose a name for your pipeline.\n  - This name will need to be unique across the whole deployment.\n  If you want this pipeline to be index-specific, we recommend including the name of your index in the pipeline name.\n  - If you do not set the pipeline name, a default unique name will be provided upon selecting a trained model.\n2. Select the ML trained model you want to use.\n  - The model must be deployed before you can select it.\n  To begin deployment of a model, click the *Deploy* button.\n3. Select one or more source fields as input for the inference processor.\n  - If there are no source fields available, your index will need a <<mapping, field mapping>>.\n4. (Optional) Choose a name for your target field(s).\nThis is where the output of the inference model will be stored. Changing the default name is only possible if you have a single source field selected.\n5. Add the source-target field mapping to the configuration by clicking the *Add* button.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each field mapping you want to add.\n7. (Optional) Test the pipeline with a sample document.\n8. (Optional) Review the pipeline definition before creating it with the *Create pipeline* button.\n\n[discrete#ingest-pipeline-search-inference-manage-inference-processors]\n===== Manage and delete inference processors from your ML inference pipeline\n\nInference processors added to your index-specific ML inference pipelines are normal Elasticsearch pipelines.\nOnce created, each processor will have options to *View in Stack Management* and *Delete Pipeline*.\nDeleting an inference processor from within the *Content* UI deletes the pipeline and also removes its reference from your index-specific ML inference pipeline.\n\nThese pipelines can also be viewed, edited, and deleted in Kibana via *Stack Management -> Ingest Pipelines*, just like all other Elasticsearch ingest pipelines.\nYou may also use the <<ingest-apis,Ingest pipeline APIs>>.\nIf you delete any of these pipelines outside of the *Content* UI in Kibana, make sure to edit the ML inference pipelines that reference them.\n\n[discrete#ingest-pipeline-search-inference-test-inference-pipeline]\n==== Test your ML inference pipeline\n\nYou can verify the expected structure of the inference output before indexing any documents while creating the {ml} inference pipeline under the *Test* tab.\nProvide a sample document, click *Simulate*, and look for the `ml.inference` object in the results.\n\nTo ensure the ML inference pipeline will be run when ingesting documents, you must make sure the documents you are ingesting have a field named `_run_ml_inference` that is set to `true` and you must set the pipeline to `{index_name}`.\nFor connector and crawler indices, this will happen automatically if you've configured the settings appropriately for the pipeline name `{index_name}`.\nTo manage these settings:\n\n  1. Go to *Search > Content > Indices > <your index> > Pipelines*.\n  2. Click on the *Settings* link in the *Ingest Pipelines* card for the `{index_name}` pipeline.\n  3. Ensure *ML inference pipelines* is selected.\n     If it is not, select it and save the changes.\n\n[discrete#ingest-pipeline-search-inference-learn-more]\n==== Learn More\n\n* See <<ingest-pipeline-search-in-enterprise-search>> for information on the various pipelines that are created.\n* Learn about {ml-docs}/ml-nlp-elser.html[ELSER], Elastic's proprietary retrieval model for semantic search with sparse vectors.\n* https://huggingface.co/models?library=pytorch&pipeline_tag=token-classification&sort=downloads[NER HuggingFace Models^]\n* https://huggingface.co/models?library=pytorch&pipeline_tag=text-classification&sort=downloads[Text Classification HuggingFace Models^]\n* https://huggingface.co/models?library=pytorch&pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&sort=downloads[Text Embedding HuggingFace Models^]\n"
