When it fills\nup, the documents in the buffer are written to a segment on disk. It is divided\nbetween all shards on the node.\n\nThe following settings are _static_ and must be configured on every data node\nin the cluster:\n\n`indices.memory.index_buffer_size`::\n(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)\nAccepts either a percentage or a byte size value. It defaults to `10%`,\nmeaning that `10%` of the total heap allocated to a node will be used as the\nindexing buffer size shared across all shards.\n\n`indices.memory.min_index_buffer_size`::\n(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)\nIf the `index_buffer_size` is specified as a percentage, then this\nsetting can be used to specify an absolute minimum. Defaults to `48mb`.\n\n`indices.memory.max_index_buffer_size`::\n(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)\nIf the `index_buffer_size` is specified as a percentage, then this\nsetting can be used to specify an absolute maximum. Defaults to unbounded.\n"
