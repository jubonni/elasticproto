This issue is fixed in 8.15.0.\n\n* The `pytorch_inference` process used to run Machine Learning models can consume large amounts of memory.\nIn environments where the available memory is limited, the OS Out of Memory Killer will kill the `pytorch_inference`\nprocess to reclaim memory. This can cause inference requests to fail.\nElasticsearch will automatically restart the `pytorch_inference` process\nafter it is killed up to four times in 24 hours. (issue: {es-issue}110530[#110530])\n\n[[bug-8.14.2]]\n[float]\n=== Bug fixes\n\nData streams::\n* Ensure a lazy rollover request will rollover the target data stream once. {es-pull}109636[#109636]\n* [Data streams] Fix the description of the lazy rollover task {es-pull}109629[#109629]\n\nES|QL::\n* Fix ESQL cancellation for exchange requests {es-pull}109695[#109695]\n* Fix equals and hashcode for `SingleValueQuery.LuceneQuery` {es-pull}110035[#110035]\n* Force execute inactive sink reaper {es-pull}109632[#109632]\n\nInfra/Scripting::\n* Check array size before returning array item in script doc values {es-pull}109824[#109824] (issue: {es-issue}104998[#104998])\n\nInfra/Settings::\n* Guard file settings readiness on file settings support {es-pull}109500[#109500]\n\nMachine Learning::\n* Fix IndexOutOfBoundsException during inference {es-pull}109533[#109533]\n\nMapping::\n* Re-define `index.mapper.dynamic` setting in 8.x for a better 7.x to 8.x upgrade if this setting is used. {es-pull}109341[#109341]\n\nRanking::\n* Fix for from parameter when using `sub_searches` and rank {es-pull}106253[#106253] (issue: {es-issue}99011[#99011])\n\nSearch::\n* Add hexstring support byte painless scorers {es-pull}109492[#109492]\n* Fix automatic tracking of collapse with `docvalue_fields` {es-pull}110103[#110103]\n"
