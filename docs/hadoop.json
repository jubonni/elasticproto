For\nfull details please refer to the ES-Hadoop documentation, in particular the\n`Security` section.\n\nFor authentication purposes, select the user for your ES-Hadoop client (for\nmaintenance purposes it is best to create a dedicated user). Then, assign that\nuser to a role with the privileges required by your Hadoop/Spark/Storm job.\nConfigure ES-Hadoop to use the user name and password through the\n`es.net.http.auth.user` and `es.net.http.auth.pass` properties.\n\nIf PKI authentication is enabled, setup the appropriate `keystore` and `truststore`\ninstead through `es.net.ssl.keystore.location` and `es.net.truststore.location`\n(and their respective `.pass` properties to specify the password).\n\nFor secured transport, enable SSL/TLS through the `es.net.ssl` property by\nsetting it to `true`. Depending on your SSL configuration (keystore, truststore, etc...)\nyou might need to set other parameters as well - please refer to the\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/hadoop/current/configuration.html[ES-Hadoop] documentation,\nspecifically the `Configuration` and `Security` chapters.\n"
