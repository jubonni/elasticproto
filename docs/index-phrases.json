This allows exact phrase queries (no slop) to run more efficiently, at the expense\nof a larger index. Note that this works best when stopwords are not removed,\nas phrases containing stopwords will not use the subsidiary field and will fall\nback to a standard phrase query. Accepts `true` or `false` (default)."
