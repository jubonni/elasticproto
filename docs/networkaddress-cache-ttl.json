With a security manager in\nplace, the JVM defaults to caching positive hostname resolutions indefinitely\nand defaults to caching negative hostname resolutions for ten\nseconds. Elasticsearch overrides this behavior with default values to cache\npositive lookups for sixty seconds, and to cache negative lookups for ten\nseconds. These values should be suitable for most environments, including\nenvironments where DNS resolutions vary with time. If not, you can edit the\nvalues `es.networkaddress.cache.ttl` and `es.networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl`\nin the <<set-jvm-options,JVM options>>. Note that the values\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html[`networkaddress.cache.ttl=<timeout>`]\nand\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html[`networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl=<timeout>`]\nin the\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/PolicyFiles.html[Java\nsecurity policy] are ignored by Elasticsearch unless you remove the settings for\n`es.networkaddress.cache.ttl` and `es.networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl`.\n"
