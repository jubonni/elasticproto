Use the\n<<delete-snapshot-api,Delete snapshots API>> to remove the {search-snap} from\nyour snapshot repository when it is no longer needed.\n+\nSee <<searchable-snapshots-reliability,Reliability of {search-snaps}>> for\nfurther information about deleting {search-snaps}.\n\nWARNING: If a policy with a searchable snapshot action is applied on an existing searchable snapshot index,\nthe snapshot backing this index will NOT be deleted because it was not created by this policy. If you want\nto clean this snapshot, please delete it manually after the index is deleted using the <<delete-snapshot-api, delete snapshot API>>, you\ncan find the repository and snapshot name using the <<indices-get-index, get index API>>.\n\n[[ilm-delete-action-ex]]\n==== Example\n\n[source,console]\n--------------------------------------------------\nPUT _ilm/policy/my_policy\n{\n  \"policy\": {\n    \"phases\": {\n      \"delete\": {\n        \"actions\": {\n          \"delete\" : { }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n--------------------------------------------------\n"
