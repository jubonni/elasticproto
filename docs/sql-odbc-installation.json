The installation process is simple and is composed of standard MSI wizard steps.\n\n[[prerequisites]]\n==== Installation Prerequisites\n\nThe recommended installation platform is Windows 10 64 bit or Windows Server 2016 64 bit.\n\nBefore you install the {odbc} you need to meet the following prerequisites;\n\n* .NET Framework 4.x full, latest - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework\n* Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017 or later - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist\n- The 64 bit driver requires the x64 redistributable\n- The 32 bit driver requires the x86 or the x64 redistributable (the latter also installs the components needed for the 32 bit driver)\n* Elevated privileges (administrator) for the User performing the installation.\n\nIf you fail to meet any of the prerequisites the installer will show an error message and abort the installation.\n\nNOTE: It is not possible to inline upgrade using the MSI. In order to upgrade, you will first have to uninstall the old driver and then install the new driver.\n\nNOTE: When installing the MSI, the Windows Defender SmartScreen might warn\nabout running an unrecognized app. If the MSI has been downloaded from\nElastic's web site, it is safe to acknowledge the message by allowing the\ninstallation to continue (`Run anyway`).\n\n[[odbc-compatibility]]\n==== Version compatibility\n\ninclude::../version-compat.asciidoc[]\n\n[[download]]\n==== Download the `.msi` package(s)\n\nDownload the `.msi` package for {odbc} {version} from:\nhttps://www.elastic.co/downloads/odbc-client\n\nThere are two versions of the installer available:\n\n- *32 bit driver (x86)* for use with the Microsoft Office 2016 suite of applications; notably Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access and other 32 bit based programs.\n- *64 bit driver (x64)* recommended for use with all other applications.\n\nUsers should consider downloading and installing both the 32 and 64 bit drivers for maximum compatibility across applications installed on their system.\n\n[[installation-gui]]\n==== Installation using the graphical user interface (GUI)\n\nDouble-click the downloaded `.msi` package to launch a GUI wizard that will guide you through the installation process.\n\nYou will first be presented with a welcome screen:\n\nimage::images/sql/odbc/installer_started.png[Installer Welcome Screen]\n\nClicking *Next* will present the End User License Agreement. You will need to accept the license agreement in order to continue the installation.\n\nimage::images/sql/odbc/installer_accept_license.png[Installer EULA Screen]\n\nThe following screen allows you to customise the installation path for the Elasticsearch ODBC driver files.\n\nNOTE: The default installation path is of the format: *%ProgramFiles%\\Elastic\\ODBCDriver{backslash}{version}*\n\nimage::images/sql/odbc/installer_choose_destination.png[Installer Driver Path]\n\nYou are now ready to install the driver.\n\nNOTE: You will require elevated privileges (administrator) for installation.\n\nimage::images/sql/odbc/installer_ready_install.png[Installer Begin]\n\nAssuming the installation takes place without error you should see progress screen, followed by the finish screen:\n\nimage::images/sql/odbc/installer_installing.png[Installer Installing]\n\nOn the finish screen you can launch the ODBC Data Source Administration screen by checking the dialog checkbox. This will automatically launch the configuration screen on close (either 32 bit or 64 bit) where you can configure a DSN.\n\nimage::images/sql/odbc/installer_finish.png[Installer Complete]\n\nAs with any MSI installation package, a log file for the installation process can be found within the `%TEMP%` directory, with a randomly generated name adhering to the format `MSI<random>.LOG`.\n\nIf you encounter an error during installation we would encourage you to open an issue https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-sql-odbc/issues, attach your installation log file and provide additional details so we can investigate.\n\n[[installation-cmd]]\n==== Installation using the command line\n\nNOTE: The examples given below apply to installation of the 64 bit MSI package. To achieve the same result with the 32 bit MSI package you would instead use the filename suffix `windows-x86.msi`\n\nThe `.msi` can also be installed via the command line. The simplest installation using the same defaults as the GUI is achieved by first navigating to the download directory, then running:\n\n[\"source\",\"sh\",subs=\"attributes,callouts\"]\n--------------------------------------------\nmsiexec.exe /i esodbc-{version}-windows-x86_64.msi /qn\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBy default, `msiexec.exe` does not wait for the installation process to complete, since it runs in the Windows subsystem. To wait on the process to finish and ensure that `%ERRORLEVEL%` is set accordingly, it is recommended to use `start /wait` to create a process and wait for it to exit:\n\n[\"source\",\"sh\",subs=\"attributes,callouts\"]\n--------------------------------------------\nstart /wait msiexec.exe /i esodbc-{version}-windows-x86_64.msi /qn\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAs with any MSI installation package, a log file for the installation process can be found within the `%TEMP%` directory, with a randomly generated name adhering to the format `MSI<random>.LOG`. The path to a log file can be supplied using the `/l` command line argument\n\n[\"source\",\"sh\",subs=\"attributes,callouts\"]\n--------------------------------------------\nstart /wait msiexec.exe /i esodbc-{version}-windows-x86_64.msi /qn /l install.log\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSupported Windows Installer command line arguments can be viewed using:\n\n[\"source\",\"sh\",subs=\"attributes,callouts\"]\n--------------------------------------------\nmsiexec.exe /help\n--------------------------------------------\n\n...or by consulting the https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa367988(v=vs.85).aspx[Windows Installer SDK Command-Line Options].\n\n[[odbc-msi-command-line-options]]\n===== Command line options\n\nAll settings exposed within the GUI are also available as command line arguments (referred to as _properties_ within Windows Installer documentation) that can be passed to `msiexec.exe`:\n\n[horizontal]\n`INSTALLDIR`::\n\n  The installation directory.\n  Defaults to ++%ProgramFiles%\\Elastic\\ODBCDriver{backslash}{version}++.\n\nTo pass a value, simply append the property name and value using the format `<PROPERTYNAME>=\"<VALUE>\"` to\nthe installation command. For example, to use a different installation directory to the default one:\n\n[\"source\",\"sh\",subs=\"attributes,callouts\"]\n--------------------------------------------\nstart /wait msiexec.exe /i esodbc-{version}-windows-x86_64.msi /qn INSTALLDIR=\"c:\\CustomDirectory\"\n--------------------------------------------\n\nConsult the https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa367988(v=vs.85).aspx[Windows Installer SDK Command-Line Options]\nfor additional rules related to values containing quotation marks.\n\n[[odbc-uninstall-msi-gui]]\n===== Uninstall using Add/Remove Programs\n\nThe `.msi` package handles uninstallation of all directories and files added as part of installation.\n\nWARNING: Uninstallation will remove **all** contents created as part of installation.\n\nAn installed program can be uninstalled by pressing the Windows key and typing `add or remove programs` to open the system settings.\n\nOnce opened, find the Elasticsearch ODBC Driver installation within the list of installed applications, click and choose `Uninstall`:\n\n[[odbc-msi-installer-uninstall]]\nimage::images/sql/odbc/uninstall.png[]\n\n[[odbc-uninstall-msi-command-line]]\n===== Uninstall using the command line\n\nUninstallation can also be performed from the command line by navigating to the directory\ncontaining the `.msi` package and running:\n\n[\"source\",\"sh\",subs=\"attributes,callouts\"]\n--------------------------------------------\nstart /wait msiexec.exe /x esodbc-{version}-windows-x86_64.msi /qn\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSimilar to the install process, a path for a log file for the uninstallation process can be passed using the `/l` command line argument\n\n[\"source\",\"sh\",subs=\"attributes,callouts\"]\n--------------------------------------------\nstart /wait msiexec.exe /x esodbc-{version}-windows-x86_64.msi /qn /l uninstall.log\n--------------------------------------------\n"
