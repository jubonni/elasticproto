This issue is fixed in 8.15.0.\n\n[[bug-8.12.2]]\n[float]\n=== Bug fixes\n\nApplication::\n* Fix bug in `rule_query` where `text_expansion` errored because it was not rewritten {es-pull}105365[#105365]\n* [Connectors API] Fix bug with crawler configuration parsing and `sync_now` flag {es-pull}105024[#105024]\n\nAuthentication::\n* Validate settings before reloading JWT shared secret {es-pull}105070[#105070]\n\nDownsampling::\n* Downsampling better handle if source index isn't allocated and fix bug in retrieving last processed tsid {es-pull}105228[#105228]\n\nES|QL::\n* ESQL: Push CIDR_MATCH to Lucene if possible {es-pull}105061[#105061] (issue: {es-issue}105042[#105042])\n* ES|QL: Fix exception handling on `date_parse` with wrong date pattern {es-pull}105048[#105048] (issue: {es-issue}104124[#104124])\n\nIndices APIs::\n* Always show `composed_of` field for composable index templates {es-pull}105315[#105315] (issue: {es-issue}104627[#104627])\n\nIngest Node::\n* Backport stable `ThreadPool` constructor from `LogstashInternalBridge` {es-pull}105165[#105165]\n* Harden index mapping parameter check in enrich runner {es-pull}105096[#105096]\n\nMachine Learning::\n* Fix handling of `ml.config_version` node attribute for nodes with machine learning disabled {es-pull}105066[#105066]\n* Fix handling surrogate pairs in the XLM Roberta tokenizer {es-pull}105183[#105183] (issues: {es-issue}104626[#104626], {es-issue}104981[#104981])\n* Inference service should reject tasks during shutdown {es-pull}105213[#105213]\n\nNetwork::\n* Close `currentChunkedWrite` on client cancel {es-pull}105258[#105258]\n* Fix leaked HTTP response sent after close {es-pull}105293[#105293] (issue: {es-issue}104651[#104651])\n* Fix race in HTTP response shutdown handling {es-pull}105306[#105306]\n\nSearch::\n* Field-caps should read fields from up-to-dated shards {es-pull}105153[#105153] (issue: {es-issue}104809[#104809])\n\nSnapshot/Restore::\n* Finalize all snapshots completed by shard snapshot updates {es-pull}105245[#105245] (issue: {es-issue}104939[#104939])\n\nTransform::\n* Do not log warning when triggering an `ABORTING` transform {es-pull}105234[#105234] (issue: {es-issue}105233[#105233])\n* Make `_reset` action stop transforms without force first {es-pull}104870[#104870] (issues: {es-issue}100596[#100596], {es-issue}104825[#104825])\n\n[[enhancement-8.12.2]]\n[float]\n=== Enhancements\n\nIdentityProvider::\n* Include user's privileges actions in IdP plugin `_has_privileges` request {es-pull}104026[#104026]\n\n\n"
