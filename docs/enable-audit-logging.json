You must explicitly enable audit logging.\n============================================================================\n--\nTIP: Audit logs are only available on certain subscription levels.\nFor more information, see {subscriptions}.\n--\n\nTo enable audit logging:\n\n. Set `xpack.security.audit.enabled` to `true` in `elasticsearch.yml`.\n. Restart {es}.\n\nWhen audit logging is enabled, <<audit-event-types, security events>> are persisted to\na dedicated `<clustername>_audit.json` file on the host's file system, on every cluster node.\nFor more information, see <<audit-log-output>>.\n\nYou can configure additional options to control what events are logged and\nwhat information is included in the audit log.\nFor more information, see <<auditing-settings>>.\n"
