By default, all\nfeature states are included in a snapshot if that snapshot includes the global\nstate, or none if it does not.\n\nA feature state includes one or more system indices necessary for a given\nfeature to function. In order to ensure data integrity, all system indices that\ncomprise a feature state are snapshotted and restored together.\n\nThe features listed by this API are a combination of built-in features and\nfeatures defined by plugins. In order for a feature's state to be listed in this\nAPI and recognized as a valid feature state by the create snapshot API, the\nplugin which defines that feature must be installed on the master node.\n\n==== {api-examples-title}\n\n[source,console-result]\n----\n{\n    \"features\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"tasks\",\n            \"description\": \"Manages task results\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"kibana\",\n            \"description\": \"Manages Kibana configuration and reports\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n----\n// TESTRESPONSE[skip:response differs between default distro and OSS]\n"
